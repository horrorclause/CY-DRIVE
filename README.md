the beginnings of a mobile app that I am in the works of developing for my company. It will make logging trips easier for field technicians, and enable easy exporting of logged trips as excel files. 

The idea is that a mobile app can be used for the field techs to track their trips while they are on the road, eliminating the need of having to stop and open your laptop and manually enter the trips, or having a third party app constantly tracking your location in the background on your phone. The trips are logged in a SQL database. All records, or specific records can be exported as Excel spreadsheets with the openpyxl module.
